# Demowork
So..this is my first sample project hosted on github.
The project is a simple authentication application
It contains About, Contact and Login/Register Pages
I used a swiftmailer plugin but i'm yet to fix the issues around it
The db config file is attached.
Once you register a user, go to the db and chage the is_token to "1"
